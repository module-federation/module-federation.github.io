Stop Paying the "Microservice Premium"</a>
  </h4><p>Microservices are the components of distributed systems. 
  Distribute systems are inherently harder to build and manage than monoliths.
  The main reason for deploying these components across the network as individual executables is to achieve deployment independence.
  But what if we could deploy components independently wihout needing to distribute them?
